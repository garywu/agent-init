# Release Management Guide

This document describes the release management process for this project.

## Release Channels

### ðŸš€ Development (`main` branch)
- **Purpose**: Active development and integration
- **Stability**: Unstable, may contain breaking changes
- **Updates**: Continuous
- **Use when**: You want the latest features and don't mind instability

### ðŸ§ª Beta (`beta` branch)
- **Purpose**: Testing and early access
- **Stability**: Mostly stable, suitable for testing
- **Updates**: Weekly (every Monday)
- **Use when**: You want early access to new features with reasonable stability

### âœ… Stable (`stable` branch)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready releases
- **Stability**: Fully stable and tested
- **Updates**: Monthly or as needed
- **Use when**: You need reliability for production use

## Installation by Channel

### For Stable Releases (Recommended)
```bash
# As a git submodule
git submodule add -b stable https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git path/to/submodule

# Or clone directly
git clone -b stable https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
```

### For Beta Testing
```bash
# As a git submodule
git submodule add -b beta https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git path/to/submodule

# Or clone directly
git clone -b beta https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
```

### For Development
```bash
# As a git submodule (tracks main)
git submodule add https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git path/to/submodule

# Or clone directly
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
```

## Updating

### Update Submodules
```bash
# Update to latest version in tracked branch
git submodule update --remote --merge

# Update and commit
git add path/to/submodule
git commit -m "chore: update submodule to latest version"
```

### Update Direct Clones
```bash
# Fetch and merge latest changes
git fetch origin
git merge origin/stable  # or origin/beta or origin/main
```

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** for stable releases (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N** for beta releases (e.g., `v1.2.3-beta.4`)
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.N** for release candidates (if used)

### Version Bumping Rules

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require user action
- **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

## Release Schedule

### Beta Releases
- **When**: Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- **What**: All changes from main branch
- **Version**: Automatic bump based on conventional commits
- **Testing**: One week testing period before stable promotion

### Stable Releases
- **When**: Monthly or when critical fixes are needed
- **What**: Promoted from tested beta releases
- **Version**: Clean version without pre-release suffix
- **Announcement**: GitHub release with full changelog

### Hotfix Releases
- **When**: Critical issues in stable that can't wait
- **What**: Minimal changes to fix specific issues
- **Version**: Patch version bump
- **Process**: Fix â†’ Release â†’ Backport to beta and main

## Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic versioning:

### Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types That Trigger Releases

| Type | Release | Version Bump | Example |
|------|---------|--------------|---------|
| `feat` | Yes | Minor | `feat: add new API endpoint` |
| `fix` | Yes | Patch | `fix: resolve memory leak` |
| `feat!` | Yes | Major | `feat!: change API response format` |
| `fix!` | Yes | Major | `fix!: correct behavior (breaking)` |

### Other Types (No Release)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Breaking Changes
Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body or use `!` after the type:
```
feat!: remove deprecated API

BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/v1/users endpoint has been removed.
Use /api/v2/users instead.
```

## Testing Requirements

### Beta Testing Checklist
- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] New features work as documented
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities

### Stable Promotion Criteria
- [ ] Beta has been available for at least 1 week
- [ ] No critical issues reported
- [ ] All planned features are complete
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Migration guide available (if needed)

## Rollback Procedures

### Rolling Back a Release
```bash
# 1. Identify the last good version
git tag -l | grep -E "^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$" | sort -V

# 2. Create a rollback branch
git checkout -b rollback/vX.Y.Z stable

# 3. Reset to the previous version
git reset --hard vX.Y.Z

# 4. Force push (requires admin rights)
git push --force-with-lease origin rollback/vX.Y.Z:stable

# 5. Create a new patch release noting the rollback
```

### Communication During Rollback
1. Create an issue explaining the rollback
2. Pin the issue to the repository
3. Update the release notes
4. Notify users through available channels

## FAQ

### Q: How do I know which version I'm using?
A: Check the VERSION file or run `git describe --tags`

### Q: Can I skip beta and go straight to stable?
A: No, all changes must go through beta testing first

### Q: How do I request a hotfix?
A: Create an issue with the `critical` and `bug` labels

### Q: What if I need a specific feature faster?
A: You can track the `main` branch, but be aware of potential instability

### Q: How are breaking changes communicated?
A: Through release notes, issues, and the BREAKING CHANGES section
