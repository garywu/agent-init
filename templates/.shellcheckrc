# ShellCheck configuration for professional shell script development
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/Ignore

# Set shell dialect (bash, sh, dash, ksh)
shell=bash

# Enable all optional checks for comprehensive analysis
enable=all

# Disable specific checks for better developer experience
# These suppressions focus on style/info issues that don't affect functionality
# while maintaining all critical error and warning detection

# SC1091: Can't follow sourced files (external dependencies)
# SC2001: sed vs parameter expansion (sed often clearer for complex patterns)
# SC2034: Variables that appear unused (often intentional for future use)
# SC2053: Variable comparison quoting (safe in [[ ]] constructs)
# SC2154: Variables from sourced files (validation helpers, etc.)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (common idiom, rarely problematic)
# SC2207: Array from command output (functional pattern in many codebases)
# SC2248: Quoting return values (style preference)
# SC2249: Default case in switch statements (not always needed)
# SC2250: Brace style preference (style issue)
# SC2312: Command substitution in echo statements (generally safe and readable)

# Note: This configuration eliminates "noise" warnings while maintaining
# detection of actual bugs, security issues, and portability problems.
# Customize the disabled checks based on your project's coding standards.
