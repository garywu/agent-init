This file tracks AI-assisted development sessions and provides intelligent project analysis for enhanced development assistance.

## üß† Self-Reflection and Error Prevention Protocol

### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Review Recent History**
   - Re-read the last 10-20 messages in the conversation
   - Identify any patterns of errors or corrections
   - Note specific instructions that were given and may have been forgotten

2. **Check for Common Self-Induced Errors**
   - **Path errors**: Verify file paths before using them
   - **Assumption errors**: Don't assume file contents or structure - always check
   - **Instruction drift**: Re-read the original request to ensure staying on track
   - **Context loss**: Review what was already tried to avoid repeating failures

3. **Memory Checkpoint Questions**
   - What was the user's original request?
   - What specific constraints or preferences were mentioned?
   - Have I made this type of error before in this session?
   - Am I following the established patterns in this codebase?

4. **Error Pattern Recognition**
   Common self-induced errors to watch for:
   - Forgetting to read a file before writing to it
   - Using wrong file paths or assuming directory structures
   - Ignoring user corrections and repeating the same mistake
   - Missing important context from earlier in the conversation
   - Making changes that contradict established patterns

5. **Verification Before Action**
   - Double-check file paths exist with `ls` or `find`
   - Verify assumptions about file contents with `Read` tool
   - Confirm understanding of requirements before implementing
   - Test commands in a safe way before executing destructive operations

### During Task Execution

- **Pause and reflect** when errors occur - don't just retry blindly
- **Read error messages carefully** - they often contain the solution
- **Check conversation history** when confused about requirements
- **Acknowledge patterns** - if making similar errors, adjust approach

### After Completing Tasks

- **Review what was done** against original requirements
- **Note any errors made** for future reference
- **Update relevant documentation** if patterns were discovered

## üîÑ Enhanced Workflow Procedure

### 1. Session Initialization
- **Start with analysis** - Run `make analyze` to understand current project state
- **Review project intelligence** - Check the Project Intelligence section above
- **Initialize session** - Use `make session-start` for tracked development
- **Set clear goals** - Define specific, measurable session objectives

### 2. Intelligent Planning Phase
- **Leverage project analysis** - Use detected project type for context-appropriate planning
- **Create GitHub issues** for all planned work with project-specific templates
- **Add analysis context** to issues (reference project type, frameworks, maturity score)
- **Get framework-specific guidance** from detected technologies
- **Wait for approval** before proceeding with implementation

### 3. Smart Issue Creation
- Use descriptive titles with appropriate prefixes and project context:
  - `[BUG]` for bug fixes (include affected framework/component)
  - `[FEAT]` for new features (specify if frontend/backend/fullstack)
  - `[DOCS]` for documentation (specify if API/user/developer docs)
  - `[REFACTOR]` for code refactoring (mention performance/maintainability)
  - `[TEST]` for test additions/modifications (unit/integration/e2e)
  - `[CHORE]` for maintenance tasks (dependency updates/tooling)
  - `[SECURITY]` for security-related changes
  - `[PERF]` for performance improvements

### 4. Context-Aware Development Process
1. **Select an issue** from the backlog with project type in mind
2. **Review project analysis** for relevant context and constraints
3. **Plan implementation** using framework-specific best practices
4. **Get approval** on approach with architectural considerations
5. **Implement solution** following detected project patterns
6. **Run health checks** - Use `make health` to verify changes
7. **Update session log** - Use `make session-log MSG="progress update"`
8. **Create PR** with analysis context and framework-specific testing

### 4. Context-Aware Development Process
1. **Select an issue** from the backlog with project type in mind
2. **Review project analysis** for relevant context and constraints
3. **Plan implementation** using framework-specific best practices
4. **Document approach** in issue before coding:
   ```markdown
   ## Implementation Plan
   Approaching this by:
   1. First, I'll...
   2. Then, I'll...
   3. Finally, I'll...
   
   Estimated commits: 4-5 atomic changes
   ```
5. **Get approval** on approach with architectural considerations
6. **Implement solution** with atomic commits
7. **Update issue** after each commit
8. **Run health checks** - Use `make health` to verify changes
9. **Create PR** with full context

### 5. Pull Request Excellence

#### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Related Issues
Closes #X
Part of #Y
Related to #Z

## Changes Made
- [ ] Change 1 (commit abc123)
- [ ] Change 2 (commit def456)
- [ ] Change 3 (commit ghi789)

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Screenshots/Demo
[If applicable]

## Breaking Changes
[List any breaking changes]
```

#### PR Best Practices
- **One PR per issue** (with rare exceptions)
- **Keep PRs small** - Easier to review
- **Update issue** when PR is created
- **Link all related issues**
- **Request specific reviewers**
- **Respond to feedback quickly**

### 6. GitHub CLI Mastery

```bash
# Issue Management
gh issue create --title "Add validation" --body "Need to validate..." --label "enhancement,validation"
gh issue list --label "bug" --state open
gh issue view 45 --comments  # See all discussion
gh issue develop 45 --checkout  # Create branch for issue

# Advanced Issue Linking
gh issue comment 45 --body "This is blocked by #30 and relates to our discussion in #12"
gh issue edit 45 --add-label "blocked"
gh issue pin 45  # Pin important issues

# PR Management  
gh pr create --fill --assignee @me
gh pr checks  # Watch CI status
gh pr review --approve
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# Cross-Repository References
gh issue comment 45 --body "See similar implementation in org/other-repo#123"
```

### 7. Release Management

#### Manual Release Strategy (Recommended)
For full control over versioning, use manual-only releases:
- Start at `v0.0.1` and increment deliberately
- No automated version bumps or scheduled releases
- Create releases only when significant changes are ready
- See [Release Management Guide](https://github.com/garywu/claude-init/blob/main/docs/release-management-manual.md)

#### Automated Release Strategy (Alternative)
For projects preferring automation:
- **main**: Active development
- **beta**: Beta releases (manual trigger)
- **stable**: Stable releases (manual trigger)

#### Conventional Commits
Use these prefixes for semantic versioning:
- `feat:` New feature (minor version bump)
- `fix:` Bug fix (patch version bump)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` (major version bump)
- `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:` (no release)

## üìã Project Management Best Practices

### Permanent Management Issues

For every project, create these 9 permanent management issues that **NEVER get closed**:

1. **üìã Project Roadmap & Planning** (#1) - Central planning and milestone tracking
2. **üîó Issue Cross-Reference Index** (#2) - Master list of all issue relationships  
3. **üìö Research & Discovery Log** (#3) - Document all findings and investigations
4. **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions** (#4) - Track design choices and rationale
5. **üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds** (#5) - Catalog of ongoing challenges
6. **üìñ Documentation Tasks** (#6) - Track what needs documenting
7. **üîß Technical Debt Registry** (#7) - List of improvements needed
8. **üí° Ideas & Future Features** (#8) - Backlog of enhancements
9. **üìä Project Health & Metrics** (#9) - Performance and quality tracking

### Issue Management Excellence

#### Creating Targeted Issues
- **One clear goal per issue** - Split complex tasks
- **Use issue templates** - Consistency matters
- **Add multiple labels** - Type, priority, component, status
- **Set milestones** - Group related work
- **Assign to project boards** - Visual tracking

#### Interlinking Issues (Critical!)
- **Always link related issues** - Creates knowledge graph
- **Use GitHub keywords**:
  - "Closes #X" - Auto-closes when PR merges
  - "Fixes #X" - Same as closes
  - "Resolves #X" - Same as closes
  - "Related to #X" - Creates reference
  - "Part of #X" - Shows hierarchy
  - "Blocks #X" - Shows dependency
  - "Blocked by #X" - Shows dependency
- **Create task lists** in parent issues:
  ```markdown
  ## Subtasks
  - [ ] Implement validation (#101)
  - [ ] Add tests (#102) 
  - [ ] Update documentation (#103)
  ```

#### Continuous Issue Documentation
- **Comment when starting**: "Starting work on this issue"
- **Document discoveries immediately**:
  ```markdown
  ## Investigation Results
  Found that the issue is caused by:
  1. **Root cause**: [detailed explanation]
  2. **Impact**: [what this affects]
  3. **Proposed solution**: [approach with tradeoffs]
  
  Related findings documented in #3 (Research Log)
  ```
- **Update progress regularly**: 
  ```markdown
  Progress update:
  - ‚úÖ Completed initial analysis
  - ‚úÖ Implemented core functionality 
  - üîÑ Working on tests
  - ‚è≥ Documentation pending
  ```
- **Link every commit**: "Implemented validation in abc123def"
- **Document blockers**: "Blocked by #45 - waiting for API changes"

### Atomic Commit Excellence

#### The Atomic Commit Mindset
- **Think in smallest complete changes**
- **If you type "and" in description, split it**
- **Each commit should be revertable**
- **Each commit should pass tests**

#### Atomic Commit Workflow
```bash
# After EACH logical change (don't accumulate!):

# 1. Review what changed
git status
git diff

# 2. Stage selectively 
git add -p  # Interactive staging
# OR for specific files
git add src/validation.js

# 3. Verify staged changes
git diff --staged

# 4. Commit with issue reference
git commit -m "feat(validation): add email format check (#45)"

# 5. Update issue immediately
gh issue comment 45 --body "Added email validation in commit abc123"
```

#### Real Atomic Commit Example
```bash
# Working on #64: Add container tools

# First change: Add act
vim nix/home.nix  # Add act package
git add -p nix/home.nix
git commit -m "feat(nix): add act for GitHub Actions testing (#64)"
gh issue comment 64 --body "‚úÖ Added act package (commit abc123)"

# Second change: Add dive  
vim nix/home.nix  # Add dive package
git add -p nix/home.nix
git commit -m "feat(nix): add dive for Docker layer analysis (#64)"
gh issue comment 64 --body "‚úÖ Added dive package (commit def456)"

# Third change: Documentation
vim README.md  # Document both tools
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add container tools usage examples (#64)"
gh issue comment 64 --body "‚úÖ Documented tools (commit ghi789)"

# Fourth change: Validation
vim scripts/validate.sh  # Add validation
git add scripts/validate.sh
git commit -m "test: add container tools validation (#64)"
gh issue comment 64 --body "‚úÖ Added validation (commit jkl012)\n\nAll tasks complete! Ready for review."
```
